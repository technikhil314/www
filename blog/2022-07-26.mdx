I was trying to create my own implementation of debounce and throttle. Yes just for fun.
and I came up with very simplified implementation that anyone can follow just by taking a look at the code.

You can play with the [demo here](https://debounce-throttle.surge.sh/)

Hope you like it.

## Throttle

```js
function throttle(fun, timeduration) {
  let shouldCall = true;
  return (...args) => {
    if (shouldCall) {
      shouldCall = false;
      fun(...args);
      setTimeout(() => {
        shouldCall = true;
      }, timeduration);
    }
  };
}
```

## Debounce

```js
function debounce(fun, timeduration) {
  let lastTimeoutId = 0;
  return (...args) => {
    if (lastTimeoutId) {
      clearTimeout(lastTimeoutId);
    }
    lastTimeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      fun(...args);
    }, timeduration);
  };
}
```

## How to use it

```js
function showValue(val) {
  console.log(val);
}

const throttleInput = throttle(showValue, 500);

const debouncedInput = debounce(showValue, 500);
```
